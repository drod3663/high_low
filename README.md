# High Low Game in PHP

You are going to build a game using the CLI.

The specs for the game are:

game picks a random number between 1 and 100.
prompts user to guess the number
if user's guess is less than the number, it outputs "HIGHER"
if user's guess is more than the number, it outputs "LOWER"
if a user guesses the number, the game should declare "GOOD GUESS!"
